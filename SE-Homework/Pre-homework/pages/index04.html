                I come from a beackground of health and wellness. My twenty year practice of massage therapy has been a source of comfort and joy. However, even good things have their end date and I am in this program to start on a new path. I am elated to be here.
                It's been a very trying time for many and as an advocate for self care, I would suggest everyone get massage.
                I would suggest <a href="https://www.opalcenter.com/">Opal Center for massage therapy</a> . They are both an endearing bunch and exceptional professionals in the field.
