                I come from a beackground of health and wellness. My twenty year practice of massage therapy has been a source of comfort and joy. However, even good things have their end date and I am in this program to start on a new path. I am elated to be here.
                It's been a very trying time for many and as an advocate for self care, I would suggest everyone get massage.
                I would suggest <a href="https://www.opalcenter.com/">Opal Center for massage therapy</a> . They are both an endearing bunch and exceptional professionals in the field.

<ul><h3>Ways I Self-Care</h3>

    <li>Get plenty of sleep and at least 3 liters of water a day.</li>
    <li>Dry brushing the skin followed by self massage to help clear lymph nodes and muscles.</li>
    <li>Take any opportunity to move the body. I'm an advocate for dancing.</li>
    <li>Remember that no situation lasts forever and it's best to just be attentive to the present moment.</li>
