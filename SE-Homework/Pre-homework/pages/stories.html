        I love cheese and crackers because it requires no time to prepare and its always satisfying. But sometimes comfort food can heighten anxiety by making you worry about your waistline. In those times I do some kind of yogic breathing to calm myself.

        Movies from my childhood can be grounding and give an emotional boost. I'm a fan of animation and fantasy movies.
